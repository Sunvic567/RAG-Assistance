# Artificial Intelligence (AI)

## 1. Definition
Artificial Intelligence (AI) refers to computer systems designed to perform tasks that typically require human intelligence—learning, reasoning, problem-solving, perception, and language understanding. AI systems use algorithms, statistical models, and neural architectures to mimic aspects of human cognition.

## 4. AI System Architecture (Simplified)
Data → Preprocessing → Feature Extraction → Model Training → Inference → Feedback Loop

- Data: foundation; quality and quantity matter.
- Model: algorithmic core (neural nets, trees, etc.).
- Inference: applying learned patterns.
- Feedback: continuous learning or fine-tuning.

## 5. Key Concepts
- Intelligence vs. AI: AI replicates computation-based reasoning, not consciousness.  
- Narrow vs. General AI:
  - Narrow AI: task-specific systems (ChatGPT, AlphaGo).
  - General AI: hypothetical human-level general intelligence.  
- Bias & Fairness: models inherit dataset biases—mitigation required.  
- Explainability (XAI): making model decisions interpretable.
